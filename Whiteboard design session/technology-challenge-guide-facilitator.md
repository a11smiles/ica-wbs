# Financial Services Modernization Technology Challenge Attendee Guide

## Starter artifacts

Contoso Ltd. has prepared a set of artifacts they felt may help to accelerate your PoC efforts. They have expressed that you are not required to use these at all if the do not benefit the PoC you have identified. Also, they are very much open to you starting your PoC from scratch or leveraging other materials you already have.

The following table summarizes each of the available PoC resources. The documentation on where to get and how to use each PoC starter follows the table

| PoC                              | Starter Artifacts                                                                                                 | Description |
