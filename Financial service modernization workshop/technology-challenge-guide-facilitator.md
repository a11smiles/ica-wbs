# Financial Services Modernization Technology Challenge Attendee Guide

The technology challenge is your opportunity to show Contoso Ltd. how you might approach their solution and address their concerns by delivering a PoC. 

Your goal for the technology challenge is to create customer confidence in your proposed solution and ultimately to ask you for a statement of work (SOW) to proceed. 

Tomorrow, you will have the opportunity to meet with Contoso Ltd. and present back your solution. You should come prepared with the following artifacts:

* Overall solution diagram in PowerPoint or Visio
* Solution diagram of PoC 
* Demo of working PoC
* Be prepared to provide a summary of what the PoC proves out and demonstrates


## Starter artifacts

Contoso Ltd. has prepared a set of artifacts they felt may help to accelerate your PoC efforts. They have expressed that you are not required to use these at all if the do not benefit the PoC you have identified. Also, they are very much open to you starting your PoC from scratch or leveraging other materials you already have.

The following table summarizes each of the available PoC resources. The detailed documentation on what each starter includes, where to get the starter and how to use each PoC starter follows the table.
