#  Financial Services Modernization design challenge session attendee guide

## Interactive Design Challenge

Analyze your customer's needs and design a preliminary solution.

In this phase, the "customer representatives" join attendee teams. "Customers" and attendees work through an ADS agenda,  discovering requirements (current and future state) and whiteboarding a solution. Each team will be assigned different solution scenarios. Individuals self-evaluate whiteboarding based on co-created rubric.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Directions:**  

Meet your table participants and facilitator. The facilitator will play the role of the customer in an ADS with a team of attendees.


## Design Challenge scoping and next steps

Complete the overall solution design on the whiteboard and work with the customer to identify the PoC, scope the PoC and whiteboard the PoC design. 

Timeframe: 45 minutes

**Directions:**

Attendee teams and "customer representatives" make first cut on PoC implementation scope and next steps based on customer constraints for their scenario. 


## Architecture showcase and testing

Attendee team presents solution back to room of peers, justifying design decisions and improving design based on feedback.

Timeframe: 90 minutes

**Directions**

Attendee teams present back their architecture and first-pass implementation plan to room. Each presentation will represent the reasoning behind the architectural decisions they made. To further strengthen the architecture, a large-group discussion will follow each presentation to proof-test it with real-world implementation experiences, identifying its potential points of failure, high-availability, and its maintainability over time.

Your goal is to be prepared to present your solution architecture and planned PoC back to the customer the following day to get approval from the customer to proceed with the PoC implementation.
