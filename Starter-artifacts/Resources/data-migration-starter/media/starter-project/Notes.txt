1. When creating entity context, only include tables, and only under the NW schema

2. After creating the new SQL DataContext, the call to base must be changed to:
       : base("name=SqlServerConnectionString")

3. After changing to the SQL context, the code in the HomeController must be switched.
       Additionally, the SALESBYYEAR.YEAR, and the SalesByYearViewModel.Year model properties must be changed from string to int.

4. After converting to SQL Server, the SALES_BY_YEAR procedure will break. In Solution Items is SALES_BY_YEAR_fix.sql which will fix the conversion error.
